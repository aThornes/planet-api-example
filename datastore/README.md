# Data store

For this example application we will be using a local data filestore as a database rather than a true database system such as MongoDB or SQL

This datastore will simply store files to the local file system, in practise this should never be implemented to store data

Later on we will introduce MongoDB as a useful database and a bonus task for this work could be to convert the application to use a real database rather than this store.
